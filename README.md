# Quotes Worthy of Remembering

If people treat you like an option, **leave them like a choice**. Yes, I'm a nice person, but you've crossed the line too many times. They said I changed a lot, and I said **a lot... changed... me**! When trust is broken, sorry means nothing. Before you judge me make sure that YOU... ARE... PERFECT! **Be careful who you trust; salt and sugar look the same**. Sometimes you just have to play the role of a fool, to fool the fool who things they are fooling you. I smiled again, not because I was happy, but because I was strong!
